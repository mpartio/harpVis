\arguments{
\item{verif_data}{Output from \link[harpPoint]{ens_verif},
\link[harpPoint]{det_verif}, or a harpPoint verification function for
individual scores.}

\item{score}{The score to plot. Should be the name of one of the columns in
the verification tables or the name of a dervived score, such as
\code{spread_skill}, \code{spread_skill_ratio}, or
\code{brier_score_decomposition}.}

\item{verif_type}{The type of verification to plot for ensemble verification
data. The default is "ens", but set to "det" to plot verification scores
for members. If set to "det", you should also set colour_by = member.}

\item{x_axis}{The x-axis for the plot. The default is leadtime, but could
also be threshold. For some scores this is overrided.}

\item{y_axis}{The y-axis for the plot. The default is to take the same as the
score input, and for most scores this is overrided.}

\item{colour_by}{The column to colour the plot lines or bars by. The default
is mname, for the model name. Set to NULL for all lines / bars to have the
same colour.}

\item{extend_y_to_zero}{Logical. Whether to extend the y-axis to include
zero.}

\item{facet_by}{The column(s) to facet the plot by. Faceting is a term used
for generating plot panels. The argument must be wrapped inside the
\link[dplyr]{vars} function - e.g. \code{facet_by = vars(threshold)}.}

\item{num_facet_cols}{Number of columns in the faceted plot.}

\item{facet_scales}{Should facet scales be fixed ("fixed", the default), free
("free"), or free in one dimension ("free_x", "free_y")?}

\item{linetype_by}{The column to set the line types of the plot by.}

\item{line_width}{The width of lines to plot. The default is 1.1.}

\item{point_size}{The size of points to plot. Set to 0 for no points. The
default is 2.}

\item{filter_by}{Filter the data before plotting. Must be wrapped inside the
\link[dplyr]{vars} function. This can be useful for making a single plot
where there are many groups. For example, for reliability there should be
one plot for each lead time and threshold, so the data can be filtered with
e.g. \code{filter_by = vars(leadtime == 12, threshold == 280)}.}

\item{plot_title}{Title for the plot. Set to "auto" to automatically generate
the title. Set to "none" for no title. Anything else inside quotes will be
used as the plot title.}

\item{plot_subtitle}{Subtitle for the plot. Set to "auto" to automatically
generate the subtitle. Set to "none" for no subtitle. Anything else inside
quotes will be used as the plot subtitle.}

\item{plot_caption}{Caption for the plot. Set to "auto" to automatically
generate the caption Set to "none" for no caption. Anything else inside
quotes will be used as the plot caption.}

\item{x_label}{Label for the x-axis. Set to "auto" to automatically generate
the label from the data. Set to "none" for no label. Anything else inside
quotes will be used as the x-axis label.}

\item{y_label}{Label for the y-axis. Set to "auto" to automatically generate
the label from the data. Set to "none" for no label. Anything else inside
quotes will be used as the y-axis label.}

\item{legend_position}{The position of legends ("none", "left", "right",
"bottom", "top", or two-element numeric vector).}

\item{num_legend_rows}{The maximum number of rows in the legend.}

\item{log_scale_x}{Logical - whether to plot the x-axis on a log scale.}

\item{log_scale_y}{Logical - whether to plot the y-axis on a log scale.}

\item{colour_theme}{The colour theme for the plot - can be any ggplot2 theme
(see \link[ggplo2]{theme_grey}), or "theme_harp_grey",
"theme_harp_midnight", or "theme_harp_black".}

\item{...}{Arguments to \link[ggplot2]{theme}}
}
\value{
A plot. Can be saved with \link[ggplot2]{ggsave}.
}
\description{
\code{plot_point_verif} is used to plot verification scores computed by
functions from the harpPoint package. The function uses non standard
evaluation (NSE) meaning that none of the arguments should be quoted. For
arguments that can take more than one value, (\code{facet_by} and
\code{filter_by}), the arguments should be wrapped inside the
\link[dplyr]{vars} function.
